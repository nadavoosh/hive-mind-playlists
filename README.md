# hive-mind-spotify

This small webserver takes an [AskMetaFilter](ask.metafilter.com) URL as an input, parses the responses to try to identify song recommendations, and searches spotify for those recommendations. The result is a spotify playlist generated by the OP. When the question was actually about songs, this ususally produces a playlist of the right flavor. When the question was about something else entirely, the playlist is too. 

# Running locally
Export a `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` (you can generate one [here](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard)).
Then just `make install-deps` and run `python main/__init__.py` to start the local flask server.
