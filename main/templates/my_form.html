    Ask Metafilter is a wonderful community of question askers and answerers. Sometimes, people ask for song recommendations.
</p>
<p>
    You can point me at a song recommendation thread, and I will search spotify for the songs in that thread.
</p>
<p>
    Enter the URL of the Ask Metafilter question you'd like to scan for song recommendations.
